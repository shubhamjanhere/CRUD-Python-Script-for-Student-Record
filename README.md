# CRUD-Python-Script-for-Student-Record
Implement a cache that on start-up would load data from a file into the cache. The cache would have an initial size of 20  elements and upon reaching its limit, to add any new element it would remove the least recently accessed element. On shutdown  it should store the cached data back to the file. The data should be stored in the cache according to a caching strategy.  Provide options for cache CRUD. Testing Dataset : records of students. You need to create the test dataset. The student  record would have data such as - their ID's, classes enrolled and marks obtained in them. The records should be cached  in a sorted manner according to the student marks.
